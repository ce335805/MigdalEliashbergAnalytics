Mathematica notebook for the analytic solution of the gap equation in arXiv:2303.02176 (Eq. 10 and Eq. 11 of that reference).
Two Matsubara sums are evaluated analytically by inserting poles with appropriate approximations as discussed in the paper.
The resulting expression is split into 4 terms for simplification and converted to C code for the numerical implementation of the k-sums.

The notebook can be run with Mathematica and will take a few minutes on a typical laptop.
